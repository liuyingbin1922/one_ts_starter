# one_ts_starter

## start

At first, I want to share the knowledge of TS, as we all know , TS  has a lot of points, so as first, I want to share the TS web front end project at first. 

So I init the TS project , using  eslint , doc , and build options.

Therefore , we can use the starter project right now cause it has the ability of unit testing , doc and build.

Have fun enjoying it.
